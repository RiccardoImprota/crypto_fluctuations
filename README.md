# Cryptocurrency Telegram Price Fluctuation Notifier and Predictor 
Developed by Jacopo Mocellin, Riccardo Improta

University of Trento - June 2021

--------

This project constitutes the final deliverable for the Big Data Technologies course at the University of Trento, academic year 2020/2021.

Project objective:
 * Design and implement a big data system for detecting and predicting sudden variations (> X% on a daily basis) for a set of cryptocurrencies.Â

## Project overview
In this project, we developed a near-real-time notification system served via a Telegram bot. This Bot updates the user of the price fluctuations of his/her preferred cryptocurrencies. The user is also informed of our prediction for the closing prices of the cryptos.

- This project scrapes the closing price history of all the most used cryptos. 
- The prices are then processed in different ways:
  - A model is used to predict the current day closing price for each given crypto.
  - The current price of each crypto is scraped every minute, compared to the previous day price and a percentage of change of the price is calculated for each crypto.
- Particular care has been given to the serving layer: a fully-functioning telegram bot that is capable of storing the user preferences and sends notifications based on those preferences.


### How the code works in detail:

It is recommended to consult the [project wiki](https://github.com/trelium/crypto_fluctuations/wiki/Crypto_fluctuations-wiki) for more informations if the user wants to use or enchance the code.

## Usage

To use this code, it is suggested to rely on the Dockerfile, which is an image that will run all the scripts correctly and provide a fully-working bot.
If the user wants to run the code without relying on the Docker Image, it is suggested to consult The [running the code](https://github.com/trelium/crypto_fluctuations/wiki/Crypto_fluctuations-wiki#running) section of the wiki.

To run either the Dockerfile or the code, a `.env` should be inserted in the main folder crypto_fluctuations. This file should be formatted like this:
```
# Credentials to access SQL instance on 
SQL_SERVER="<name>.database.windows.net"
SQL_DATABASE=
SQL_USERNAME=
SQL_PASSWORD=
SQL_DRIVER="{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}"


# Credentials to access Telegram bot configuration 
KEY = "123456789abcdefghi"

# MQtt broker address
BROKER_ADDRESS="localhost" (or any IP)
```



An external MQTT broker and Microsoft SQL server are needed to run either the dockerfile or the code. More details about how to configure these two services are presented in the next two sections.

### MQTT broker
A functioning MQTT broker must be setup to use most of the services.
An environment variable called 'BROKER_ADDRESS' should be present with the IP of the broker.
for example: `BROKER_ADDRESS="localhost"`

It is recommended to edit the `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` file by inserting these two changes:
```
allow_anonymous true #(the code will work even without this setting, but it's easier to implement and debug new features while if it allows anonymous)
max_inflight_messages 0 #(otherwise it will not function properly in asynchronous mode)
```

### SQL server
A database in Microsoft SQL server should be present for the project to work.
Various environment variables should be present for the code to work flawlessly:
```
# Credentials to access SQL instance on 
SQL_SERVER="<name>.database.windows.net"
SQL_DATABASE=
SQL_USERNAME=
SQL_PASSWORD=
SQL_DRIVER="{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}"
```

As for the needed tables: the code in _database.py_ will generate them automatically if they are not already present in the database.
The two tables will be called _pricehistory_ and _users_.

## Telegram Bot tutorial and examples:
An environment variable called 'KEY' should be present with your API key for telegram bots.
```KEY=123456789abcdefghi```
	
The bot is fairly self-explanatory and should not be difficult for the end user to use.
The users have to input a list of the cryptos they are interested in and the percentage of gains/loss after which they want to be notified. The bot will send a maximum of one notification for crypto per day to not overload the user.


The commands available to the user are:
- *\help* to guide the user to start the bot
- *\start* to start the bot
- *\stop* to stop the bot
- *\settings* for updating the user preferences
- *\supportedcoins* to know which coins are supported by the bot
	
### Example of how the bot works :
	
Here the user starts the bot.

---

The user then states his/her preferences and activates the notification service.

---

After a few minutes, the user receives his/her notifications and after that he/she stops the service to not receive more notifications the day after.
