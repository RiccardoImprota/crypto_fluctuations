# Cryptocurrency Telegram Price Fluctuation Notifier and Predictor 

 * Design and implement a big data system for detecting and predicting sudden variations (> X% on a daily basis) for a set of cryptocurrencies.Â 

## Project overview
- This project scrapes the closing price history of all the most used cryptos. 
- The prices are then processed in different ways:
  - A model is used to predict the current day closing price for each given crypto.
  - The current price of each crypto is scraped every minute, compared to the previous day price and a percentage of change in price is calculated for each crypto.
- Particular care has been given to the serving layer: a fully-functioning telegram bot that is capable of storing the user preferences and sends notifications based on those preferences.
