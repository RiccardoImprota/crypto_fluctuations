## Project overview
- This project scrapes the closing price history of all the most used cryptos. 
- The prices are then processed in different ways:
  - A model is used to predict the current day closing price for each given crypto.
  - The current price of each crypto is scraped every minute, compared to the previous day price and a percentage of change in price is calculated for each crypto.
- Particular care has been given to the serving layer: a fully-functioning telegram bot that is capable of storing the user preferences and sends notifications based on those preferences.


### How the code works in detail:

It is recommended to consult the [project wiki](https://github.com/trelium/crypto_fluctuations/wiki) for more informations if the user wants to use or enchance the code.

## Running the code

This project offers different services that can be run separately:
* These two services should be run once a day:
	* _apihistoricprices.py_ is used to scrape the price histories and publishes the in a customized 	scraper/<name of the crypto> topic
	* _historicingestion.py_ subscribes to the aforementioned topics and loads the data in a Microsoft SQL 	Server table

* These three services will run until manually stopped:
	* _apicurrentpercentages.py_ calculates the daily price percentage change of each crypto and sends them in 	a 	"percentagechange" MQTT Topic
	* _notifier.py_ subscribes to the "percentagechange" topic, filters which user should be notified and 	sends the notifications.
	* _servinglayer.py_ is used to start the telegram bot.

The MQTT services run at QOS 1, as such they can be run synchronously or asynchronously.

The other services, _predictor.py_,_projecttoolbox.py_ and _database.py_ , manage some back-end processes and as such it is not necessary for the user to run them.
