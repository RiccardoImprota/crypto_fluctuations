---------    MQTT Subscriber and Notification sender   ---------
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Developed by Jacopo Mocellin, Riccardo Improta 
University of Trento - June 2021.

---- Description----
This scripts acts as the subscriber of the "percentagechange" MQTT topic.
After that it processes the messages by looking which user should be notified about change of prices
and sends a notification to that user.

Core features:
    * Subscribes to the mqtt topic with a static client id.
    * Sends a notification to the user for each given crytpo if:
        * their desired percentage of change has been met
        * they have "active" in the dbo.users set as TRUE
        * No notification for this crypto has been sent to the user today (used to not overload the user with information)

Other functionalities:
    * The MQTT subscriber is working in QOS 1
